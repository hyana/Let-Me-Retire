You look at Ian through the mirror and without thinking you pull the trigger and kill him. 
You don¡¯t regret your decision. You knew that at the end either Jake or Ian was going to die and you weren¡¯t going to let Jake be the person who dies. 
You realize that you need to get rid of the body, so you contact your old boss from your spy job and ask him to do you a favor. 
With the body gone and everything back to how it was you call Jake and apologize for not telling him the truth from the beginning. 
Jake comes back home and both of you guys return to your happy married life.
