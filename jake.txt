You call Jake but he doesn¡¯t pick up the phone so you leave a voicemail.
¡°Jake, I know that you are mad right now but I need you to believe me when I say that it is not safe for you to come back home yet. Ian will kill you. 
I will let you know when it¡¯s safe for you to come back home again. I love you¡¦¡±
After calling Jake, you decide to call Ian and fool him to do what he wants.
¡°Hi Ian, you are right. I do miss the old days. Come by my house and let's talk about it more.¡±
¡°What made you suddenly change your mind?"
¡°Just come, please.¡±
