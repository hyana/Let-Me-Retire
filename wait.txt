You prepare yourself with weapons around the house before Ian arrives. 
As soon as he enters through the front door. You fire fast. Bullets rip up the walls. Framed photos shatter! You chase Ian into the kitchen. 
Ian fires back. He whips open the refrigerator. You enter the kitchen firing but your bullets pop off the steel door of the refrigerator. You push past the door and chase Ian into the hallway. 
Ian aims up on the run and fires at hanging cable attached to the chandelier. The cable snaps and the Chandelier drops straight down on you. You hop the wreckage and lunge into the living room. 
You emerge into the living room, spinning, with gun hands stretched in both directions. 
Covering all corners. No Ian. 
You look up. 
In the mirror, you see Ian.
