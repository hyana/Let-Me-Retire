You look at Ian through the mirror, and you realize you can¡¯t pull the trigger. You can¡¯t kill a person you once loved. 
While deep in thought, you didn¡¯t notice that Jake is being held hostage by Ian. ¡°Y/N, honey...what¡¯s going on...¡±
You groan with frustration. Ian is holding Jake at gunpoint.
¡°Is either me or him, Y/N. You must choose right now.¡±
¡°Ian, please. Please don¡¯t do this.¡±
¡°If you don¡¯t want to, then.¡±
¡°NO!!!¡±
POW! Ian pulls the trigger killing Jake. The blood is flowing out from Jake¡¯s head, and you go crazy with a cry from the depth of misery. 
You pull the trigger. POW! The blood is flowing out from Ian¡¯s chest. 
Ian is hysterically giggling at you. ¡°So this is your choice.¡± Ian falls dead. 
In front of you stand, the blackish blood from two dead bodies of two men that you loved are staining the white carpet. 
You realize that you need to get rid of the bodies, so you contact your old boss from your spy job and ask him to do you a favor. 
After that night, you never loved again.
