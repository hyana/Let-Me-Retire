¡°Honey, come over here and listen to this voicemail¡± Jake says in a serious tone.
¡°Coming!¡± you respond.
¡°Hi Y/N! Did you miss me?¡±
As soon as you hear his voice, you know that it was Ian. 
¡°I¡¯m a little upset, I see that you got married. How could you forget about me so easily? Your enemy, your unrequited love, Ian.¡±
Ian was your long-time enemy from your days as a secret agent or at least that¡¯s how you guys met. Somewhere along trying to kill each other, you both began to harbor feelings for each other. 
But like he said it was unrequited love. Two agents from competing agent institutions could never be together. 
Also, when you met Jake, you soon forgot about Ian or so you thought.
¡°Who is Ian?!¡± Jake says.
