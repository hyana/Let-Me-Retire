When you get to Central Park the place is deserted and it is dark and you can¡¯t spot where Ian is. Suddenly you hear a gunshot and your gun is shot out of your hand and it lands across the park. 
You feel the cold metal in the back of your head. Then you realize that Ian is holding you at gunpoint. 
¡°Wow, you lost your skills. How could you hold your gun in that position? I¡¯m disappointed in you.¡±
¡°What do you want from me? I don¡¯t want to come back to the spy life. I¡¯m happy right now with Jake, MY HUSBAND!¡±
¡°You couldn¡¯t come back to the spy life even if you wanted to. You lost all your skills¡±
¡°Ok then leave me and my husband alone!¡±
¡°Why do you keep bringing him up? It¡¯s annoying me¡¦ or if your husband is your problem, I can fix that for you.¡±
¡°Leave us alone! Please!¡± you plead Ian. Ian giggles crazily and leaves.
