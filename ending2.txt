As you look up Ian through the mirror, you realize that you can not pull the trigger. All your memories of Ian flash through your eyes. 
You once loved Ian. 
You thought that you totally forgot about him, but seeing him again is making you doubt yourself. Ian notices your hesitation and he walks up to you and hugs you from behind. 
¡°Ian, I¡¯m not gonna be a spy again. I don¡¯t want to be a murderer again.¡±
¡°I don¡¯t care about that.¡±
¡°Then why are you here?¡±
¡°I missed you¡¦I can¡¯t live without you. How could you leave me without saying anything?¡±
¡°You know that we couldn¡¯t be together.¡±
¡°I know, but you are not a spy anymore. I can quit being a spy too if you don¡¯t like it anymore. Just please, give me a chance!¡±
¡°I¡¯m married now!¡±
¡°Do you love him?¡±
¡°Of course, he is my husband!¡±
¡°Do you love me?¡±
¡°Ye- I don¡¯t know...I really don¡¯t know. But promise me that you won¡¯t kill Jake, please.¡± 
¡°Go on a date with me. Then I won¡¯t touch Jake.¡±
You hesitate and nod.
After that night, you are still not sure of your feelings, but at least Jake is safe now. No matter how much you want to deny it, you couldn't help but look forward to your date with Ian.
