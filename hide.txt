When you get to Central Park the place is deserted and dark. You cannot spot where Ian is. 
You stand in the middle of the park looking around when you feel the cold metal in the back of your head. 
Then you realize that Ian is holding you at gunpoint. 
¡°Are you seriously holding me at gunpoint right now?¡±
¡°Wow, you lost your skills. How could you let your guard down around me, do you trust me that much?¡±
You sense that Ian is letting his guard down so you pull off one of your moves from back in the days and reverse the situation.
¡°This is what I wanted to see. You are still so attractive like the old days.¡±
¡°Now if you don¡¯t want to die, let¡¯s come to my house and settle this.¡±
¡°Whatever you say, baby.¡±
