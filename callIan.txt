Jake is gone and it was your fault for not telling him the truth from the beginning but you cannot accept to take all the blame. If it wasn¡¯t for Ian¡¯s unexpected voicemail, then Jake would have never found out. 
It is all his fault. You have to work things out with Jake but first, you have to get rid of Ian. 
You call Ian: ¡°What do you want?!¡±
¡°I¡¯ve been terrible without you, Y/N. How about you, did you also miss me?¡±
¡°I don¡¯t have time to play these games with you, Ian.¡±
¡°Don¡¯t you want to come back to the spy life? It's boring without you, baby.¡±
¡°3 am. Central Park. See you there.¡±
You go to your secret space in the basement where you have stored all your old weapons. You grab a gun and head out to meet Ian at Central Park.
