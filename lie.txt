You couldn¡¯t tell Jake that you were a secret agent. You just couldn¡¯t so instead you tell him, ¡°He was my ex.¡±
¡°Your ex! I know all your exes and you never told me about Ian! Why didn¡¯t you tell me about him? Do you still love him?¡±
¡°No, I don¡¯t! There was nothing to tell about him that¡¯s why I didn¡¯t tell you. He is not important, at all.¡±
¡°Y/N. How could you do this to me?! I can¡¯t be with you right now. I¡¯m leaving.¡±
