You are so focused on trying to find Ian that you did not realize that Jake had come home. 
You look at Ian through the mirror and without thinking you pull the trigger and kill him. You didn¡¯t regret your decision 
then until you look to the side and you make eye contact with Jake. 
¡°Jake¡¦I...¡±
¡°Stop! Don¡¯t come any closer!!!¡±
His gaze is hazy and full of terror. He looks up at you as if you were a stranger. 
As you look back at him, you realize that you don¡¯t regret your decision. You know that if you didn¡¯t kill Ian then Ian would have killed Jake. 
However, Jake would never understand that and you know that he could never look at up at you with love anymore. So you don¡¯t beg him to stay with you. 
You know it is over but you do beg him to keep it a secret. 
It¡¯s been a month since that incident and so far Jake hasn¡¯t turned you in but you know he wouldn¡¯t keep the secret for much longer¡¦
